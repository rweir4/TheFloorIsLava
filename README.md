# platformJumper

## Background
There is a player (which has the ability to jump) and a board (which has "random" width and height platforms). If the player falls off the platforms, they die.

## MVP
1.) Board
2.) Player
3.) Start, pause, and reset of the game
4.) Modal with rules of the game
5.) Production ReadME

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
The game runs using javascript for logic, react for rendering, and canvas for sprites. I expect to use javascript for the randomness of the platforms, and may need to approach collisions using canvas.

## Wireframes
This will be a lot less involved than for your Full Stack Project, but make sure you have drawings for each view, including modals.

## Implementation Timeline:

Day 1) Board
  - sprite for platform
  - random size and placement of platforms
  - scrolling background
Day 2) Player
 - sprite for character
 - jumping
Day 3) Start, pause, reset of game, production readme
 - modal
